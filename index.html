                <p class="body-text">
                    Hi, I’m Ricardo Dell, an aspiring IT professional and
                    dedicated support specialist with a strong foundation in
                    computer engineering and a passion for technology and
                    problem-solving. I’m currently pursuing my BSc in Computer
                    Engineering at the University of Trinidad and Tobago – Point
                    Lisas, where I’ve gained hands-on experience in programming,
                    electronics, digital systems logic, and computer networks.
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    With a background in both technical IT and administrative
                    support, I’ve developed a well-rounded skill set. During my
                    time as a Web Developer and Social Media Manager at Asequith
                    Engineering and Contracting Ltd., I designed and maintained
                    websites, handled hardware repairs, and created promotional
                    content for digital platforms. I also managed spreadsheets
                    and vendor relationships, gaining real-world experience in
                    clerical operations and business support.
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    I’m proficient in Java, C#, JavaScript, PHP, and C, and
                    comfortable working with the Microsoft Office Suite to
                    produce professional reports, presentations, and datasets.
                    I’ve also developed intermediate skills in video and audio
                    editing, which I’ve applied in content creation for both
                    educational and promotional purposes. My time as a full-time
                    tutor further sharpened my communication skills,
                    adaptability, and creative thinking—qualities I bring to
                    every project, whether it’s resolving a technical issue or
                    supporting a team’s operational goals.
                </p>

                <p class="body-text">
                    I’m currently looking for opportunities in IT support,
                    office administration, or entry-level software and web
                    development roles, where I can continue learning while
                    making a meaningful contribution.
